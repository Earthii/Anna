# Anna

Anna is our ConUHacks 2019 project which aims to improve sustainable cities. We wanted to have our project be an IoT that is integrated into a set of Trash bin / Recycle Bin / Compost Bin so that when a person nerby says 'Hey Anna', they could ask Anna where they have to throw away the item.

## How is it built

Anna is built with Angular and Express, powered by Watson NLP, Webspeech API and a dataset.

## .env file
You will need a `WATSON_API_KEY` variable
